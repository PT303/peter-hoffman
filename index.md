I am a first-year PhD student at MIT advised by Professor Pablo Parrilo and Professor Gabriele Farina. I am interested in the algorithmic and machine learning foundations to decision making under unknown information.

I completed my undergratuate degree in Mathematics at MIT where I worked with Professor Pablo Parrilo on optimization solutions to the Blotto Game.
