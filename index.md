I am a final year undergraduate MIT studying mathematics. I am interested in decision-making problems involving optimization, discrete probability, and combinatorics. I currently research in convex optimiztion techniques used to solve the two-player [Blotto game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_game) from game theory supervised by [Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/).
